## What is Electron?

Electron.js is a platform for developing desktop applications using web technologies (Html, Css and JavaScript) created and maintained by Github. Electron.js works by creating two types of processes, the main process and the renderer process.

* [Introduction](Introduction)
* [Lesson 1 - Hello World](Hello-World)
* [Lesson 30 - Conclusions](Conclusions)
* [Next Steps](Next-Steps)

## Introduction

The first is a Node.js process, this is our main process, it is our application in itself, this process has access to several Electron.js Apis just for this process that help us communicate with the Os and perform different actions or effects.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
